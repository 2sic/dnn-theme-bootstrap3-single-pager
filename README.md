## Installation
### Put it into Portals/\_default or /Portals/[your-portal]
We recommend that you place this in your /Portals/\_default area, but you can also put it into your specific portal, like /Portals/0/.
The following 2 examples assume you want to put it into \_default. 

### Quick-Install Using Git Command
This assumes that you already have git installed on your pc and that you kind of have an idea what git is :)

1. In your file explorer, go to `/Portals/_default/`, then shift-right-click on the `Skins` folder and choose _Open Command Window Here_. You should now have a command-line on that folder. 
2. Run this command (and rename `SinglePager` to whatever you want): 
```
git clone https://github.com/2sic/dnn-theme-bootstrap3-single-pager "SinglePager"
```

This will automatically get the latest copy of this skin/theme and place it in the right folder. You can now use it in any layout you want. 

### Installing using Windows File Explorer

1. In your file explorer, go to `/Portals/_default/Skins/`
2. Create a new folder, call it `SinglePager` or whatever you want to call this skin. You should now have  
`/Portals/_default/Skins/SinglePager/`
3. all files from [this package](https://github.com/2sic/dnn-theme-bootstrap3-single-pager/archive/master.zip) into that folder. You should now have  
`/Portals/_default/Skins/SinglePager/` with lots of files/folders

You can now use the skin/theme wherever you want. 

## Customizing the Theme/Skin using SASS CSS
